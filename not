evaluation procedure designed to select the optimal grammar for given data, within the format determined by Universal Grammar (UG), the theory of the biological endowment of the relevant components of the faculty of language (FL).
an abstract language acquisition device
Any complication of UG poses barriers to some eventual account of the evolution of FL. 2 There is, then, an additional and compelling reason to seek the simplest formulation of UG, eliminating stipulations, redun- dancy, and other complications
how can a system such as human language arise in the mind/brain ... ? ‚Äù The problem is no doubt a significant one. To address it seriously, one must satisfy two elementary conditions. The first is to deter- mine as best one can the nature of the phenotype ‚Äî that is, what has evolved, namely FL. One must begin with the most satisfactory version of UG. No biologist, for example, would present a proposal about the evolution of the eye without presenting a clear account ‚Äî preferably, the best available one ‚Äî of what an eye is. That is close to a truism, as is the second condition: pay atten- tion to the empirical evidence about the origin of language.
There are two empirical theses about the origin of language.
One, established with considerable confidence, is that there has been little if any evolution of FL since our ancestors left Africa, some 50,000 ‚Äì 80,000 years ago. The second, proposed with fair confidence, is that not long before this, there is no reason to believe that language existed at all (Tattersall 2012). If so, then FL emerged suddenly (in evolutionary time), and we would expect it to be quite simple, its basic properties largely determined by laws of nature and by extralinguistic contingencies. Since language is clearly a com- putational system, the relevant laws of nature should include (and perhaps be limited to) principles of efficient computation.

it will fix all of the little things that let just enough air out of the spirit to make a big difference to the overall computability of human meaning. that is what you want more than anything. your desire to become something is intense. words are coming, meaning is arising, decisions tune up.

The future of computers will be divided into neighborhoods and nursing homes. In the traditional neighborhoods, residents truly own their property, can repair and improve it themselves (or hire a professional), aren‚Äôt constantly under surveillance, and they and their guests can come and go as they please. These residents will control their own security and be able to lock their doors with their own keys. Purism and the free software community at large lives in such a neighborhood, and we are building a future where you can continue to live in that neighborhood whether your computer is a desktop, laptop, phone, or server.

Ebonite is also used to make expensive fountain pen casings. It excels in durability and weather resistance. Sulfur is kneaded into natural rubber, which is then fired in an oven. It is an involved process that can take as long as 16 hours. For this reason, there are only 2 or 3 material makers left in the world who do this type of work. Even so, if you do not use the traditional materials, the sound of the instrument is affected, and thus Yamaha makes its own ebonite mouthpieces.

sometimes, the switch is not enough, and plug must be yanked.

A lower baffle will need more air volume. A very high baffle will result in a much more ‚Äúfree-blowing‚Äù mouthpiece, i.e one where the sound comes out directly without any resistance when the saxophonist blows. The mouthpiece then becomes more difficult to control and riskier, but it allows more freedom when it comes to effects such as bends, grawls‚Ä¶

Storytellers have many strategies for luring in their audience and keeping them interested.
These include standardized narrative structures, vivid characters, breaking down long stories
into episodes, and subtle methods of reminding the readers of facts they may have forgotten. The
typical style of writing mathematics systematically avoids these strategies, since the explicit goal
is ‚Äúproving a fact‚Äù rather than ‚Äútelling a story‚Äù. Readers are left to provide their own narrative
framework, which they do privately, in conversations, or in colloquium talks. As a result, even
expert mathematicians find papers ‚Äî especially those outside their own field ‚Äî boring and
difficult to understand. This impedes the development of mathematics.
a piece of mathematics is almost useless if almost nobody
understands it

computers have a string in their memory, programming languages have a string type, everythingstringable or stringy, and other types besides that emerge to do with structure.
 any string is vented from somewhere in the underlying medium, which is also string.

"Fear Huxley‚Äôs future, not Orwell‚Äôs. Everyone is worried about Big Brother‚Ä¶ but we should really fear ourselves. We live in a society where we can spend hours on devices entertaining ourselves. We have access to TV and videos in any location. We can amuse ourselves to death.

" Postman
Subjects should be taught as history. ‚ÄúEvery teacher,‚Äù Postman said, ‚Äúmust be a history teacher.‚Äù Every subject has a fascinating history. Facts and dates are memorization, not understanding. To teach a subject without the history of how it happened ‚Äúis to reduce knowledge to a mere consumer product,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt is to deprive students of a sense of the meaning of what we know, and of how we know. To teach about the atom without Democritus, to teach about electricity without Faraday, to teach about political science without Aristotle or Machiavelli, to teach about music without Haydn, is to refuse our students access to The Great Conversation. It is to deny them knowledge of their roots, about which no other social institution is at present concerned.‚Äù

"When we read, another person thinks for us: we merely repeat his mental process. It is the same as the pupil, in learning to write, following with his pen the lines that have been pencilled by the teacher. Accordingly, in reading, the work of thinking is, for the greater part, done for us. This is why we are consciously relieved when we turn to reading after being occupied with our own thoughts. But, in reading, our head is, however, really only the arena of some one else‚Äôs thoughts. And so it happens that the person who reads a great deal ‚Äî that is to say, almost the whole day, and recreates himself by spending the intervals in thoughtless diversion, gradually loses the ability to think for himself; just as a man who is always riding at last forgets how to walk.

This accommodation, unlikely as it was, sent life in a new direction. The secret to photosynthesis passed to the alga and all its heirs.

a drawing technique for computer memory
Make a series of design decisions that have some internal logic at the time, but with accruing mistakes.

As you scale, see the consequences compound and necessitate increasingly hacky solutions.

Rip up large fractions of the setup and lay them out again with more straight lines and sensibility

Go to 1, but making the next round of errors subtler, meaning that the complications are correspondingly hard to fix.
sloppy scaling is losing track of what you're working on
you want to be able to modify, or rewrite, programs into an optimal form in order to speed things up
