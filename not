evaluation procedure designed to select the optimal grammar for given data, within the format determined by Universal Grammar (UG), the theory of the biological endowment of the relevant components of the faculty of language (FL).
an abstract language acquisition device
Any complication of UG poses barriers to some eventual account of the evolution of FL. 2 There is, then, an additional and compelling reason to seek the simplest formulation of UG, eliminating stipulations, redun- dancy, and other complications
how can a system such as human language arise in the mind/brain ... ? ‚Äù The problem is no doubt a significant one. To address it seriously, one must satisfy two elementary conditions. The first is to deter- mine as best one can the nature of the phenotype ‚Äî that is, what has evolved, namely FL. One must begin with the most satisfactory version of UG. No biologist, for example, would present a proposal about the evolution of the eye without presenting a clear account ‚Äî preferably, the best available one ‚Äî of what an eye is. That is close to a truism, as is the second condition: pay atten- tion to the empirical evidence about the origin of language.
There are two empirical theses about the origin of language.
One, established with considerable confidence, is that there has been little if any evolution of FL since our ancestors left Africa, some 50,000 ‚Äì 80,000 years ago. The second, proposed with fair confidence, is that not long before this, there is no reason to believe that language existed at all (Tattersall 2012). If so, then FL emerged suddenly (in evolutionary time), and we would expect it to be quite simple, its basic properties largely determined by laws of nature and by extralinguistic contingencies. Since language is clearly a com- putational system, the relevant laws of nature should include (and perhaps be limited to) principles of efficient computation.

it will fix all of the little things that let just enough air out of the spirit to make a big difference to the overall computability of human meaning. that is what you want more than anything. your desire to become something is intense. words are coming, meaning is arising, decisions tune up.

The future of computers will be divided into neighborhoods and nursing homes. In the traditional neighborhoods, residents truly own their property, can repair and improve it themselves (or hire a professional), aren‚Äôt constantly under surveillance, and they and their guests can come and go as they please. These residents will control their own security and be able to lock their doors with their own keys. Purism and the free software community at large lives in such a neighborhood, and we are building a future where you can continue to live in that neighborhood whether your computer is a desktop, laptop, phone, or server.

Ebonite is also used to make expensive fountain pen casings. It excels in durability and weather resistance. Sulfur is kneaded into natural rubber, which is then fired in an oven. It is an involved process that can take as long as 16 hours. For this reason, there are only 2 or 3 material makers left in the world who do this type of work. Even so, if you do not use the traditional materials, the sound of the instrument is affected, and thus Yamaha makes its own ebonite mouthpieces.

sometimes, the switch is not enough, and plug must be yanked.

A lower baffle will need more air volume. A very high baffle will result in a much more ‚Äúfree-blowing‚Äù mouthpiece, i.e one where the sound comes out directly without any resistance when the saxophonist blows. The mouthpiece then becomes more difficult to control and riskier, but it allows more freedom when it comes to effects such as bends, grawls‚Ä¶

Storytellers have many strategies for luring in their audience and keeping them interested.
These include standardized narrative structures, vivid characters, breaking down long stories
into episodes, and subtle methods of reminding the readers of facts they may have forgotten. The
typical style of writing mathematics systematically avoids these strategies, since the explicit goal
is ‚Äúproving a fact‚Äù rather than ‚Äútelling a story‚Äù. Readers are left to provide their own narrative
framework, which they do privately, in conversations, or in colloquium talks. As a result, even
expert mathematicians find papers ‚Äî especially those outside their own field ‚Äî boring and
difficult to understand. This impedes the development of mathematics.
a piece of mathematics is almost useless if almost nobody
understands it

computers have a string in their memory, programming languages have a string type, everythingstringable or stringy, and other types besides that emerge to do with structure.
 any string is vented from somewhere in the underlying medium, which is also string.

"Fear Huxley‚Äôs future, not Orwell‚Äôs. Everyone is worried about Big Brother‚Ä¶ but we should really fear ourselves. We live in a society where we can spend hours on devices entertaining ourselves. We have access to TV and videos in any location. We can amuse ourselves to death.

" Postman
Subjects should be taught as history. ‚ÄúEvery teacher,‚Äù Postman said, ‚Äúmust be a history teacher.‚Äù Every subject has a fascinating history. Facts and dates are memorization, not understanding. To teach a subject without the history of how it happened ‚Äúis to reduce knowledge to a mere consumer product,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt is to deprive students of a sense of the meaning of what we know, and of how we know. To teach about the atom without Democritus, to teach about electricity without Faraday, to teach about political science without Aristotle or Machiavelli, to teach about music without Haydn, is to refuse our students access to The Great Conversation. It is to deny them knowledge of their roots, about which no other social institution is at present concerned.‚Äù

"When we read, another person thinks for us: we merely repeat his mental process. It is the same as the pupil, in learning to write, following with his pen the lines that have been pencilled by the teacher. Accordingly, in reading, the work of thinking is, for the greater part, done for us. This is why we are consciously relieved when we turn to reading after being occupied with our own thoughts. But, in reading, our head is, however, really only the arena of some one else‚Äôs thoughts. And so it happens that the person who reads a great deal ‚Äî that is to say, almost the whole day, and recreates himself by spending the intervals in thoughtless diversion, gradually loses the ability to think for himself; just as a man who is always riding at last forgets how to walk.

This accommodation, unlikely as it was, sent life in a new direction. The secret to photosynthesis passed to the alga and all its heirs.

Make a series of design decisions that have some internal logic at the time, but with accruing mistakes.

As you scale, see the consequences compound and necessitate increasingly hacky solutions.

Rip up large fractions of the setup and lay them out again with more straight lines and sensibility

Go to 1, but making the next round of errors subtler, meaning that the complications are correspondingly hard to fix.
sloppy scaling is losing track of what you're working on
you want to be able to modify, or rewrite, programs into an optimal form in order to speed things up

The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination. Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures.... Yet the program construct, unlike the poet's words, is real in the sense that it moves and works, producing visible outputs separate from the construct itself. ‚ÄîFred Brooks, The Mythical Man-Month

oh no

SOMETHING HAS GONE WRONG
caps is off!
furthermore, shift ain't always on
ETC
etc
so I dist-upgrade
because my dpkg -l libvirt* says 8.10 in book, 6.0 on bod (sa's vg)
I had typed more of this... not sure where terminal went...
 or why 'no' stopped doing so
anyway, /var/lib/libvirt/dnsmasq/default.conf has some extras on book:
domain=t
expand-hosts

and says user=libvirt-dnsmasq on bod
setting the vm containing book now to serial console mode is nice for copy-paste
so, am upgrading this Bodhi install to Jammy, hopefully nothing goes wrong...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTq-1UjrGd4
okay... Terminology taken away by conflicts, now got gnome-terminal (via tty1)

oh and! Timeshift-gtk looks good! lets let it backup unto... /dev/bod/var! bril.
...fills up var, I decrease number of time-spans to keep copies for (was daily, weekly, monthly)
it refuses to use steampow19, which is big-file-friendly but NTFS or something


anyway, the vm I have book in is now known as doud
it now refuses to start because /media/s/steampow19/virt/steves-broken-debian-that-tried-to-become-a-bookworm-ineffectually.tgz is libvirt.libvirtError: Cannot access storage file Permission denied

timeshift is backing up its own backup, in an infinite loop
I add a /var/timeshift ignore


so qemu:g starts but qemu:doud does not,
 and we have a trip to the Netherlands before h: or nico is back
qemu:g has letz, the Svelte settlement. mainly about grammaring with the new CodeMirror 6.0

I reach for my old notes for g's lack of virbr0
 also for g's lack of `ip`, which deb is it from?
I ./serve.pl
an lunatic chromium tab absorbs it
I could maybe fill in my calendar
 aha, iproute2
 which is lost when you re-podman-run
so, the networking...
or the refusing to open my backup since dist-upgrade
or another dist-upgrade..?
the networking may be in Inside / running / ...
 yes, a swathe of things to try...
 I clone qemu:g to qemu:g-clone and switch that to Usermode networking
  a cul de sac
 qemu:doud it is, not having the ntfs mode vg:book disk image.
 so sshfs has revealed that /media/s/steampow19 was root 600 (an odd owner+mode for a user mount...)
 perhaps that happens when I reboot? it was plugged in during the last one... sheesh
 now I have unplugged that around, the sshfs mount known as "vgbook" can work, has shown up in thunar as the only steampow19 manifestation, though mount says /dev/sdb1 on /media/s/steampow19
 and qemus, looking at that, can now start!
 hmmm
 when drives disconnect: [  822.330490] systemd-journald[245]: Failed to write entry (22 items, 756 bytes), ignoring: Read-only file system
 it is crash-safe!
 now as a read-only disk, the bookwork.tgz shan't mount: I/O error while writing superblock
 fair enough, I un-readonly it and etc
 steampow19 has stopped showing up in thunar...

ANYWAY
I cant seem to get to the network. my research turned up https://www.cni.dev/plugins/current/ / macvlan / no unwired internet servers allowed?
hmm, doud also has ii  slirp4netns    1.2.0-1
https://youtu.be/L5Wxobddl7A?t=704
s@sa:~/.config/libvirt/qemu/dc.xml alludes to interface / tap1
 I need to find the docs for connecting them
 I find doud's (book's) /etc/qemu/bridge.conf: allow virbr0 (and 1)
  perhaps qemu:book should happen? then I can virsh net-dumpxml
  https://libvirt.org/sources/virshcmdref/html/sect-net-create.html
okay, lets qemu:book

Is another process using the image [steves-broken-debian-that-tried-to-become-a-bookworm-ineffectually.tgz]?

yes.
it allocates the 112G qcow2, then fills it in at about 5MBps. waves of 20MBps
qemu-img putters along at 9%, then 3%...
also, we have noticed the sa:/usr/share/libvirt/networks/default.xml
so qemu-img is still going
I make up sa:/etc/qemu/bridge.conf as book: was (will soon be book.qcow2)
and now starting qemu:g-clone (with the Bridge networking) says:
 failed to communicate with bridge helper: Transport endpoint is not connected
sudo apt install uml-utilities
 failed to create tun device: Operation not permitted
I kill the qemu-img job without remembering to iotop it.
 on booting this botched qemu:book it drops to initramfs...
doing it again.

stumbling through notes is the way
 they say https://superuser.com/questions/597834 and discuss cant-add-wlan0-to-bridge
hey now!
it's not really wlan0 that is most important
 I used ssh port forwarding to get the internet in (p2p + http)
so I'm having a step back, a quick one, to this:
 https://mike42.me/blog/2019-08-how-to-use-the-qemu-bridge-helper-on-debian-10
 and he mentions right clicking on QEMU/KVM User session -> Details
  and there is virt-manager's view of virsh's net-edit, etc
  I dont think this is relevant though, because:
 "Add setuid to the qemu-bridge-helper binary."
 this is important: chmod u+s /usr/lib/qemu/qemu-bridge-helper
 and now this: 'failed to create tun device: Operation not permitted'
  (or was it 'failed to communicate with bridge helper: Transport endpoint is not connected'?)
 is no more! it runs in bridge mode!
 I can reach the guest (192.168.122.92) from the host!
 then the podmannery gets ports into the pod(docker)
  see putting code into dev @important @truth
 no other part of this page works for me though
  eg virsh # net-start default says error creating bridge interface virbr0...
 also virsh # domifaddr g-clone doesnt have em
 virsh # domiflist g-clone has a tap0 that `ip a` also has

antidepressants can trigger drug resistance [to] multiple antibiotics [...] after a few days exposure
 the antidepressants caused the cells to generate reactive oxygen species: toxic molecules that activated the microbe‚Äôs defence mechanisms. Most prominently, this activated the bacteria‚Äôs efflux pump systems, a general expulsion system that many bacteria use to eliminate various molecules, including antibiotics. This probably explains how the bacteria could withstand the antibiotics without having specific resistance genes.

 one antidepressant, sertraline, promoted the transfer of genes between bacterial cells, a process that can speed up the spread of resistance through a population

crystal frequency is multiplied to arrive at a microcontroller's clock speed. As crystal frequency gets higher, dimensions get smaller (especially thickness). Above roughly 50 MHz, AT-cut crystals become fragile, and manufacturers use third-overtone cuts for higher frequencies...some even use 5th-harmonic.
These "overtone" crystals are susceptible to rogue resonances...

The brew is typically made by boiling Banisteriopsis caapi, a giant vine, with leaves from the Psychotria viridis shrub. Its name comes from the Quechua language spoken by many Indigenous groups in the Andes, with aya meaning soul, ancestors or dead people, and wasca meaning vine or rope. Translations then vary from the spiritually enigmatic ‚Äúvine of the soul‚Äù to the somewhat less inviting ‚Äúrope of death‚Äù.

consider the collapse of local news journalism. The myth that this was caused by craigslist or Google drives me bonkers. Throughout the 80s and 90s, private equity firms and hedge funds gobbled up local news enterprises to extract their real estate. They didn‚Äôt give a shit about journalism; they just wanted prime real estate that they could develop. And news organizations had it in the form of buildings in the middle of town. - Danah Boyd
Note that black holes are not eternal, they evaporate due to Hawking radiation. For your average black hole this takes an unimaginable amount of time, but for really small ones it could happen almost instantaneously, as evaporation time is dependent on mass. Therefore your microscopic black hole must have greater than a certain threshold mass, roughly equal to the mass of Mount Everest.
 (to destroy Earth)
 Black holes are of such high density that they pass through ordinary matter like a stone through the air. The black hole will plummet through the ground, eating its way to the centre of the Earth and all the way through to the other side: then, it'll oscillate back, over and over like a matter-absorbing pendulum.

The gate or fence did not grow there. It was not set up by somnambulists who built it in their sleep. It is highly improbable that it was put there by escaped lunatics who were for some reason loose in the street. Some person had some reason for thinking it would be a good thing for somebody. And until we know what the reason was, we really cannot judge whether the reason was reasonable. It is extremely probable that we have overlooked some whole aspect of the question, if something set up by human beings like ourselves seems to be entirely meaningless and mysterious. ‚Äî G. K.

The planning fallacy describes how people tend to not consciously think through the future in detail. This leads people to overcommit to different events in the future. They then realize as the events become closer that they cannot possibly complete all of the tasks that they had planned.
 According to Construal level theory, the planning fallacy occurs because events in the distant future are construed at a higher, more abstract level, while events in the near future are construed at a lower, more concrete level.

Universe 25: lots of mice were given paradise. when their number reached 600, hierarchy broke out: alphas and wretches. The larger rodents began to attack the group, with the result that many males begin to "collapse" psychologically. As a result, the females did not protect themselves and in turn became aggressive towards their young. As time went on, the females showed more and more aggressive behavior, isolation elements and lack of reproductive mood. There was a low birth rate and, at the same time, an increase in mortality in younger rodents. Then, a new class of male rodents appeared, the so-called "beautiful mice". They refused to mate with the females or to "fight" for their space. All they cared about was food and sleep. At one point, "beautiful males" and "isolated females" made up the majority of the population.
 etc etc, homosexuality and recreational cannibalism. no new babies after two years.
