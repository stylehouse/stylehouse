      extrude some silicon treads to avoid wearing metal until fixed

     tapering down in size & stiffness
     bending towards the angle it will be
    dial in stiffness to that angle
     with shock-absorbing hydraulic suspension
     on levers, to be calibrated and bolted
      made of lots of layers of plate?
    top + bottom?
     bottom usu taking all the load
    cable clamp
     must slide through the wheels
     the unloaded side relaxes and rolls over the clamp
      which must take very minimal force
       switch suspension to another with such-play
       the lever-lock spring layer might lock|switch also...
        using force from nearby wheels rolling up|down on the clamp
         so the larger small wheels (at the high-control end)
          are relaxed by the force of their neightbours rolling over
      rolling further indirectly
       must be a multiple of the cable texture for resync

 fact
  accel
   If we double the speed we need to quadruple the length of the acceleration run if we use the same acceleration rate.
    Thus i think more than 40km/h are not feasible unless tricks like for the Rittnerbahn in Bozen are used. 
    Lets assume a speed of 12m/s =43.2km/h and a maximal acceleration of 1.2m/s^2 (legal limit for public transit in EU) and a continuous acceleration of 1m/s^2.
    Then we need a 72m long acceleration run, which can extend outside of the station building.
    There is at least one system in Japan which uses Linear induction motors instead of tires to accelerate the gondolas.
    If gondola wants its market share the need to use state of the art technology to push the performance.

    beepbeepbloopblip vanity is the surface tension of ego, by W Somerset Maugham, who writes spy stories.

    "Good gracious, no," said Ashenden. "All sensible people know that vanity is the most devastating, the most universal and the most ineradicable of the passions that afflict the soul of man, and it is only vanity that makes him deny its power. It is more consuming than love. With advancing years, mercifully, you can snap your fingers at the terror and the servitude of love, but age cannot free you from the thraldom of vanity. Time can assuage the pangs of love, but only death can still the anguish of wounded vanity. Love is simple and seeks no subterfuge, but vanity cozens you with a hundred disguises. It is part and parcel of every virtue: it is the mainspring of courage and the strength of ambition; it gives constancy to the lover and endurance to the stoic; it adds fuel to the fire of the artist's desire for fame and is at once the support and the compensation of the honest man's integrity; it leers even cynically in the humility of the saint. You cannot escape it, and should you take pains to guard against it, it will make use of those very pains to trip you up. You are defenceless against its onslaught because you know not on what unprotected side it will attack you. Sincerity cannot protect you from its snare nor humour from its mockery."

    Ashenden stopped, not because he had said all he had to say, but because he was out of breath. He noticed also that the ambassador, desiring to talk rather than to listen, heard him with a politeness that was strained. But he had made this speech not so much for his host's edification as for his own entertainment.

    "It is vanity finally that makes man support his abominable lot, carrying on with the roof in a storm, even the fluffedmarket with trips inside that which we should only be seeing the outside of at this designated time of dont-get-sick. Maybe they avoid computer work (externalising control of picking items for you) if there isn't tons of pressure. Then, suddenly... He was et by tiny organisms."



    I am all for the covid elimination, leaving any around to mutate and try again dangers. I've heard the delta variant is more transmissible and hitting vaccinated country hard. I hope someone has a nice webpage with graphs and lore? Good luck tomorrow A!
    Speaking of maxing out nature, are people in to the idea of A selling water from the very end of a couple of rivers? Maybe Clutha and something with nice old logs coming out of it, perhaps that one just for the logs, or just for the nature tea that spews out of that national park when it's stormy.
    Understand this would be the main export, state asset and resource consent for a while, establish international pneumatic tubeways, having 100 cubes of water per second (of Clutha's 600) railgunned into it in capsules big enough to send tomatoes etc back again in the weekend.
    Australia is big metal waiting to be made into a tank, next stop California... Obvious few things to plug in.
