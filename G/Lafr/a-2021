            your front end can occur since
            possibly rejecting someones push
             which would put a @Pro fail|rebase about it

      still it provides amazing vision
       &sustain s c q
        kind of describes a C in oscillation
         s is C.c
          id of the memory
         c is C.sc
          the incidentals, soul, value
          has a main bit (first $k), which matters|is most
           to our "is it still" use case
         q is more options
        id of the memory are both s + c
         but the care some lines needed around what is id for the memory
         the c (is C.sc) is more allowable to change
          without throwing away so much $a
           all sorts of lines to draw around what should &Effect what
           &Effect should synchronously resolve $n
            realising when later -Ef were merged
             when another like it emerges earlier
              similar to a Text merge ugly, see # < this patch ^ is annoying:
