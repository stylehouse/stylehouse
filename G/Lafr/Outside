    usu paint is working loose to tight,
     or tightly scooting around in a few details,
      not loosening far enough to cover the whole thing

=talks
 come in tv format
  A we used to say
   first and around
   here is inside # c
   and here is outside # sc
   two levels of inclusion-unit
   the substrate on which all of its space+time depends
    the counterpoint to the Shakespeare flutter of spirit
   
   then science explodes on the scene
    the shadows froze
    physics flowered, technical recombinations sprouted gifts
    modern life was ushered in like a new set of furniture
     the old bits left out in the rain to wash away
    its running out of tricks now of course
    while we speed around on the favelic platforming of:
   web
    the scientific community programmed up a pamphlet-flinger
     so they could communicate building the LHC
      which may destroy the world at any moment
        or when they start doing new things with it
         Wuhan may also have had a safety scope creep
       for science
        or the totally relative thing they had made of it at the time
         which was looking not so relative
          since it knew about relativity etc
           beyond Einstein! what to do there
           Einstein created a sense of slight dimensional dislocation
            like a safe thought drug, it was remarkably new
      which I would rather they put on the back burner
       at least until they raise a flock of African scientists
       to agree with them about doing it
      its remarkably like someone on drugs doing something strange
       at what point does the play get arrested
    then it was turned into a damn marketplace
     which people like because they can specialise
     gets weird
   this demarcation,
    the transport + the traveller
     eg my voice and the ghostology sprouting where it thinks we are
   is for C to seem itself
    as is all its universal qualities
   and A an indifferent medium
    A the vaguest layer of program state
    on which exists time, space, energy levels, culture, etc
   these will be the biggest and the smallest structures in the world
    they are nuanced electron sculptures
    the representations waving them at you
    and the particularity of everyones same idea about something
   
  
  welcome to stylehouse
   Im Steve, I work on the compilers
   regroup! # things move around
   these items may... and... # moves
   even thesehows and thisway # into tube, grower
   lets things float along
    and reemerge in relation to others
    we are seeing some language matching
     things on either side # ghostology
   its just like a conversation

   Anyway,
   
   we code on the ghost and run the way
    ie the ghost is a pile of knowledge
     that compiles into the way things will Run
    so the research compiles to schematics to make certain machines
   machines
    contain some uncertainties but are stable to some degree
    what about the world?
   the way must be found to be found
    most people have nothing to do (and hence worry about)

   The scientific paper—the actual form of it—was one of the enabling inventions of modernity. Before it was developed in the 1600s, results were communicated privately in letters, ephemerally in lectures, or all at once in books. There was no public forum for incremental advances. By making room for reports of single experiments or minor technical advances, journals made the chaos of science accretive. Scientists from that point forward became like the social insects: They made their progress steadily, as a buzzing mass.

   on which its functions depend
  could also mean eg

   index.html - has boot.js inlined?
    and for any /W/**, present as html transcript
     try and tag u that dont come across in such,
      add a note into there about that
       that vanishes as stylehouse loads
     that the osc adopt when they come to re-Display them

  this style of link:
    #     see &sustain / if hak(s) / tex()
  and:
 ip numbered expr
  nearby are viae e:C+\d+
   until Ctrl is released, adding \d together
  want to use tab for navigation along the writing process, eg:
 lines+markers
  ideally we could put cm-Lines in modulat,
   make it look like brackology, etc
   ie put text into a form, that is still editable
   knobs and dials
  or more likely:
   a cm with lots of markers for chunk headings,
    markers for gaps for more cm per chunk within it
   so you can just move the headings. see link
    may need some interface...
     < do cut+pastes come back with the original markers?
  mark all unicodes
   similar to diff, -String diaging eg \n characters
   avoiding: https://certitude.consulting/blog/en/invisible-backdoor/
   and offering metadata, surfing the planes
 git
  -checkout well...
   the top level W:Story or W:Index being like HEAD
    merging them with some hook?
     so it always says how you got there if you make change
      ie the research phase, code tour pre use
       as a jump in the trail
       esp if you then call that function etc
 brackets
  autoputting
   is annoy, but what if:
   'if (<here>)'
    should have ip-numbered expr nearby to import there
    by click|C+\d+
    then eg tab through to:
   '{<here>}'
     enter to start the indented line
    then S+down selects the next few lines (or as above)

     you miss out on free stuff until you sign for things
      ie return your books or no food
       both things for propping civilisation open
  network traffic
   GET something, signed to such a degree
    may yield the thing embedded in a bunch more stuff,
     and that bigger Story is what is signed.
    newer certs may help checking old certs
     they supply their previous versions
     but can also give indications of whether:
      at the end of a cert era, commit the $curse**
       the cert** that the community want to curse
       meaning revoke, for being a security hazard
      are fuzzily alluded to
       by compressing the ids of the offending **cert
       to be computed...
      so all serious hazards
       and allowable false positives
      are detectable from a few 1kb certs
        all of the intermediaries?
       and easily in reach of communities that i $curse

  "Every one knows the story of the traveler in Naples who saw twelve beggars lying in the sun (it was before the days of Mussolini), and offered a lira to the laziest of them. Eleven of them jumped up to claim it, so he gave it to the twelfth. This traveler was on the right lines. But in countries which do not enjoy Mediterranean sunshine idleness is more difficult, and a great public propaganda will be required to inaugurate it."

  cable
   how long can it last?
   how stretch?
   texture depth?
    might have clamps within the cylinder
     steel tendrils unwind
      having many arms coming off along the cable
      can have wheels at any angle around the cable
       wiggle the tendril up|down along the cable (caterpillar dance)
       to flip the arms around to another angle
       < a tangle might be convinced to jitterbug
        to balance cabin altitude
        is this analogue suspension, like a len lye

    may leave the cable entirely
     the changing end of a switch would point to the input
      a second layer of safety to the servo arm
     
    speed up to join very in sync with cable texture
     if unable to speed up or get in sync good,
      extrude some silicon treads to avoid wearing metal until fixed
    in bunches
    eg starting in plane with the big wheel
     tapering down in size & stiffness
     bending towards the angle it will be
    dial in stiffness to that angle
     with shock-absorbing hydraulic suspension
     on levers, to be calibrated and bolted
      made of lots of layers of plate?
    top + bottom?
     bottom usu taking all the load
    cable clamp
     must slide through the wheels
     the unloaded side relaxes and rolls over the clamp
      which must take very minimal force
       switch suspension to another with such-play
       the lever-lock spring layer might lock|switch also...
        using force from nearby wheels rolling up|down on the clamp
         so the larger small wheels (at the high-control end)
          are relaxed by the force of their neightbours rolling over
      rolling further indirectly
       must be a multiple of the cable texture for resync
     
  cars attachstack:
   cable clamp
    see wheels/*/$@
    can they only turn right?
     if clamp fits onto the left of the cable
     big wheel has notches the clamp must fit into?
      spacing cars, must attach exactly
       unbuffered switches must have their cables in sync
        and always be able to merge

 fact
  accel
   If we double the speed we need to quadruple the length of the acceleration run if we use the same acceleration rate.
    Thus i think more than 40km/h are not feasible unless tricks like for the Rittnerbahn in Bozen are used. 
    Lets assume a speed of 12m/s =43.2km/h and a maximal acceleration of 1.2m/s^2 (legal limit for public transit in EU) and a continuous acceleration of 1m/s^2.
    Then we need a 72m long acceleration run, which can extend outside of the station building.
    There is at least one system in Japan which uses Linear induction motors instead of tires to accelerate the gondolas.
    If gondola wants its market share the need to use state of the art technology to push the performance.

 architectural contemporaries:
  As Emily Anthes, in The Great Indoors, writes, if, say, you have a cardiac arrest, the higher you are, the longer it will take for paramedics to come to the rescue. A 2016 study of 8,000 adults who had cardiac arrests in their homes showed that 4.2 percent of patients below the third floor survived, which decreased to less than 1 percent of those who lived above the 16th floor. Above the 25th? 0 percent. In a broader sense, proponents of biophilia, such as the researcher and architect Vivian Loftness, argue that people are healthier and happier when they are closer to the street—or, to use her preferred term, the ground plane. The kernel of her argument is the important role the ground plane plays in keeping us connected—to nature, to changing temperatures, to the seasons, to other people, and to society. These connections matter. Something as simple as a view has quantifiable consequences. “Research is showing the importance of views,” said Loftness in an interview with me in 2018, “to health outcomes in hospitals…to students’ ability to concentrate in classrooms…[and] for office productivity.” Loftness argues that we should stop building high rises altogether, pointing out that Paris—with its seven-story height limit—actually has a higher density than Shanghai, with its cluster of towers on the world’s tallest list. According to her, Paris has 40 percent more density of occupants per square kilometer and 80 percent more passive survivability, should the power go out. As she said in a panel I organized with her last fall, the ground plane is the “tissue of the city with the greatest amount of environmental and social connectivity.”

 wireless
  woe
   I have neu vague data on this... is anyone else on linux|mac seeing 'wlan0: CTRL-EVENT-BEACON-LOSS' in syslog? suchly, wireless reconnects at least every 12hr20mins up to every 10 seconds in fugues lasting about 20mins, and are fatal to all TCP connections.
   testing with ping avoids that so seems more reliable as most of its packets can wait while the wireless is almost ready again. ping says 0.2-0.6% loss, RealFeel 4% loss due to the micro-outage being TCP-fatal.
   better than 7% and not being able to connect at all plenty much! the lesson there was give APs separate channels (or auto), or transmission errors will happen, particularly where the clients branch off spatially and can't hear each other to avoid collision in the AP's airspace.
   some new gear and|or a proper configuring from the provider is likely the way to go.

    beepbeepbloopblip vanity is the surface tension of ego, by W Somerset Maugham, who writes spy stories.

    "Good gracious, no," said Ashenden. "All sensible people know that vanity is the most devastating, the most universal and the most ineradicable of the passions that afflict the soul of man, and it is only vanity that makes him deny its power. It is more consuming than love. With advancing years, mercifully, you can snap your fingers at the terror and the servitude of love, but age cannot free you from the thraldom of vanity. Time can assuage the pangs of love, but only death can still the anguish of wounded vanity. Love is simple and seeks no subterfuge, but vanity cozens you with a hundred disguises. It is part and parcel of every virtue: it is the mainspring of courage and the strength of ambition; it gives constancy to the lover and endurance to the stoic; it adds fuel to the fire of the artist's desire for fame and is at once the support and the compensation of the honest man's integrity; it leers even cynically in the humility of the saint. You cannot escape it, and should you take pains to guard against it, it will make use of those very pains to trip you up. You are defenceless against its onslaught because you know not on what unprotected side it will attack you. Sincerity cannot protect you from its snare nor humour from its mockery."

    Ashenden stopped, not because he had said all he had to say, but because he was out of breath. He noticed also that the ambassador, desiring to talk rather than to listen, heard him with a politeness that was strained. But he had made this speech not so much for his host's edification as for his own entertainment.

    "It is vanity finally that makes man support his abominable lot, carrying on with the roof in a storm, even the fluffedmarket with trips inside that which we should only be seeing the outside of at this designated time of dont-get-sick. Maybe they avoid computer work (externalising control of picking items for you) if there isn't tons of pressure. Then, suddenly... He was et by tiny organisms."



    I am all for the covid elimination, leaving any around to mutate and try again dangers. I've heard the delta variant is more transmissible and hitting vaccinated country hard. I hope someone has a nice webpage with graphs and lore? Good luck tomorrow A!
    Speaking of maxing out nature, are people in to the idea of A selling water from the very end of a couple of rivers? Maybe Clutha and something with nice old logs coming out of it, perhaps that one just for the logs, or just for the nature tea that spews out of that national park when it's stormy.
    Understand this would be the main export, state asset and resource consent for a while, establish international pneumatic tubeways, having 100 cubes of water per second (of Clutha's 600) railgunned into it in capsules big enough to send tomatoes etc back again in the weekend.
    Australia is big metal waiting to be made into a tank, next stop California... Obvious few things to plug in.
    What are your thoughts.
