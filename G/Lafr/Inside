all
  from the great cold heaviness of sleep
  wake gradually
   interesting. we must arrive the chunkpile so-much (&istr_realise)
      to be able to tell what else we do
      we could go looking only for the titles we have
       if chunkpile arrived E for each indent
        then go into each as necessary
         Adj@3.1 will find A Q defs, and look up calls everywhere
          so will need a whole list of calls everywhere
           which may be stored in W:is/Fish/*, etc
             ie, ch stores defs|calls, routing to ch/**
            these call-tangles show congruence with each other, etc
             eg, parent superset-of children
             eg disparate? siblings calling the same functions (eg &Ei)
              they could also group by containing ch
         Adj@3.3 will e:say an update to a chunk, like a ghost edit
          make name clash reports about def|ch|
           an authorship is listened to
           work is spotted and somewhat intelligised
            ie compile errors in the next process
   interesting. the voice can respond to changes in demand anywhere
    it must be othered enough to connect the Dots

    I should know how an attribute should lifecycle

  podman
   writing a Dockerfile for ~/src/excm
    which is https://github.com/vizhub-core/codemirror-6-experiments
   /var was full, moves, via iotop:

     podman build -t cose .
     podman create localhost/cose:latest

    then these do `node -v`:
     podman run cose

   failing to get console access to them, to check on /js etc

       except host mode is apparently not the safest?
        it isnt listening on 192.168.1.12:1818
        presumably they mean in some complicated way
       if localhost:1812 is reused
        there is no error
         unless another container has it
          so maybe it is binding a virtual port
          then porting the port to localhost, ignorantly
   so we now run:
     podman run --rm -it --network host --name sth1 sth
    and must gives a port, or we eats it whole! :D

       When rootless, defined as being run by a regular user,

        oh?

       podman run --rm -it --network host -P --name sth1 sth ./serve.pl
         adding -P yields not podman ps to show a port mapping
        curl localhost:1818 # port configured in app
       podman run --rm -it -P --name sth1 sth
        does networking, but you have to:
         add -P to get podman ps to show a port mapping
          so it has some 0.0.0.0:40393->1818/tcp
        it seemed like curl localhost:40393 worked...
         but now says 'Connection reset by peer'
         unlike the 'Connection refused' turned up by any random port
      so
       host mode it is?

            "Searching the internet ... weird result ...
             people saying things like 'It's no problem' and the other lot saying
             'It's not possible'.. and both groups seemingly haven't heard of each other,
             ever before ;)"
           I find this again: https://serverfault.com/questions/1088736
           also https://amoldighe.github.io/2017/12/20/kvm-networking/
           but my `virsh net-list --all` is empty!
          this is a problem. reboot?
           maybe its because this is debian edu?
            if it doesnt let me change my chromium settings...
       networking afresh
         reboot to no net on the host
          the whole folly seemed so Tolkeinian
          fixed with `route add default gw $house_router`
          which I remember using decades ago :o
          Black Sabbath - Meglomania
         more reboots okay
         `vagrant up` now gets to:
           mount -o vers=4 192.168.122.1:/home/s/src/stylehouse/qemu2 /vagrant
           reason given by server: No such file or directory
         that command doesnt seem real
         host starts the sketchy sounding servive:
           org.freedesktop.Tracker1.Miner.Extract
         `strace vagrant up 2>trace.out`
           openat(AT_FDCWD, "/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libmount.so.1"
           but no command
         and still no creating a network in `virsh net-list --all`
          via the virt-manager at least...
         but can `host deb.debian.org` and thence `apt update` alright
         sudo adduser -a s wireshark
         sudo wireshark # looks better
         parses arp!
         `iptables -L -vn` shows packets per rule
         well yeah... of
       https://wiki.debian.org/KVM
         just above "Now configure the VM guests with their names"
          describes my qemu://system (not session (user))
           as seen on `virsh net-edit default`
           except I have a network/forward%dev=wlp7s0/interface%dev=wlp7s0
          and that seems to be where the guest is put
          so:
           `host steve.nz` works
           `ping steve.nz` fails: Temporary failure in name resolution
          anyway, other tasks around:
         thence is essential forms to fill in:
          /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/libvirt_dns.conf
          /etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d/libvirt_dns.conf
          hmm, should I have a domain...
           `virsh net-edit default` ++ <domain name="t"/>
           and qemu-img snap: v3-h.t-mojo
          with those configs...
           sudo on the host takes 20s to start
            should not have done thus?
           reverting (rm) those files now leaves host resolve-incapable
            unreverting, set hostname 's', and:
             /etc/hosts ++ "s.t ":
              127.0.0.1       localhost.localdomain localhost s.t s
            (and systemctl restart NetworkManager these two times)
           fixed, back to the last paragraph
         okay
          suddenly
           sucked back into no internet a third time!
           `systemctl default` sorts it out!
          to the networking already!
           lets ssh in so the guest is finally copypastable
             which 
            root@s:/var/www/html# cat ~s/.ssh/stylehouse.pub > index.html
            and `curl ... > ~s/.ssh...`
             `adduser s sudo`
             generate sshd host keys, which the cloud image couldnt come with:
             `dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server`
            then `ssh h`, having put that in the hosts /etc/hosts
            wow, locales-all is 232MB installed
             I dont know my rm-except-these
            trouble getting dhcp on init from /etc/network/interfaces
             make /etc/init.d/dhclient which works great!
            so qemu-img snapshot v3.1.1
             its 1.3G already!
            apt remove network-manager
            and install qemu-guest-agent
             which doesnt quite allow virsh dompmsuspend dc disk:
              error: internal error: S3 state is disabled for this domain
            call that v3.1.2
          disk++
           sources += contrib non-free
           `qemu-img resize disk.img +6G`
           "The only way to change a partition size using fdisk is by deleting and recreating it"
           jeez. yet `fdisk` drop and recreate do seem to work fine. resize2fs also.
            # later:
             while using debian-11-genericcloud-amd64-20221020-1174.qcow2
             this fdisk+resize2fs step seems to be redundant! hooray.
             HOWEVER
             5.10.0-19-cloud-amd64 doesnt have virtio 9p filesystem drivers!
              https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=955232
             bit of a misnomer, so you must:
              # install the normal kernel:
              sudo apt install linux-image-amd64
              # use it:
              sudo grub-set-default 'Linux, with Linux 5.10.0-19-amd64'
              # but that doesnt work, so:
              sudo vi /boot/grub/grub.cfg
              # and move stuff around... will break with next update-grub!
              #  no idea where|what really controls this...
              #  (pretty amateur, no time left to be otherwise)
              #  perhaps easier to: apt remove linux-image-5.10.0-19-cloud-amd64
              # and FINALLY
              #  after 5 hrs of other stuff
              #   after a totally hemorraged dist-upgrade
              #    probably seeking 9p support, cant remember
              sudo mount -t 9p -o trans=virtio allmusic allmusic/
              
             oh by the way,
              upnpc -e SOUL -a 192.168.1.8 2234 2234 tcp
              iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -i wlp7s0 -p tcp --dport 2234 -j DNAT \

              # is not quite it...
              
          then... to podman within!
           
  qemu/podman
   double containment!
    as per "perhaps I should put it all in a qemu"
    on h, the qemu guest and podman host:
    `podman build -t sth .` from Containerfile:
      with even a trivial RUN command:
        STEP 3/5: RUN ls -lh	
        error running container: error from /usr/bin/crun creating container for [/bin/sh -c ls -lh]: sd-bus call: Interactive authentication required.: Permission denied
       builds okay via sudo
       must then run via sudo as well
        podman * is per user?
        vaguely remember hearing this is better anyway
    `sudo podman build -t sth .`
    `sudo podman run --rm -it -P --name sth1 sth`
      and changing listen to 0.0.0.0:1818
      on s: curl h:43001 # works!
      on h:
       sudo podman ps -a # tells you that port
      brilliant.
      now back to..?
       excm?
   excm (~src/excm @d3b89d8be9)
    the new codemirror sounds good
     like it could do all the parsing for compilation
     storing intelligised source code...
    git clone it to h:
     `sudo podman build -t exc .`
      @db002dd3c7: will need .git to do submodules
       "added 587 packages," sheesh
     `sudo podman run --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE --rm -it --name exc1 exc`
      to `strace bun i lerna`
       no idea why it suddenly exits after:
        sched_getaffinity(0, 128, [0, 1])       = 8
      OH, you just need also to add --security-opt seccomp=unconfined
       might be easier to work with bun on ~/src/codeserv...
     `sudo podman run -P --rm -it --name exc1 exc`
      on guest: `lerna run start --stream` (tentatively becoming CMD)
       and its available on s !
       but: Uncaught ReferenceError: events is not defined

      that ip is findable via:
       < `virsh domifaddr gox` should work, not showing anything
         and neither does net-list, perhaps Usermode Networking skips this
       in virt-manager info for the NIC
       or in `ssh gox` with `ip a`
        (h renamed gox for a while, see hard drive crash!)
        but not in the podman container
      
      
       
     
    
    aside: tried using sshfs before, but it doesnt transmit inotify:
     sshfs -o reconnect,ServerAliveInterval=15,ServerAliveCountMax=3 -o allow_other s:src src
     # allow_other has to be allowed - follow on screen instructions
     #  because of later `sudo podman run ...` as root

      200K for a blank 1337G volume
       + 200K for partition table
       + 1.2G for "filesystem accounting information"
     it has taken days to do 60G of the 450G,
      burning lots of cpu, yet only for 1-2MiB/s
    to winscp into h (virsh instance 'dc')
     set up forwarding through s on the flat lan:
      ssh -L sl:2022:h:22 h
      (syncthing pod defied having an ssh server)
     nope, its about as slow
      even though the connection is more direct (I think?)
      syncthing uses 150% cpu on h, yet h uses 60% cpu on s (20% mem)
    anyway

       we are in ~/src/stylefavela in a podman
       meanwhile svelte seems to have stopped being so sleek:
        'ReferenceError: closeDescriptionPopup is not' when reloading
        'Function called outside component initialization' 
       now in ~/src/letz (in a podman)
        it is a `npm create svelte` with a wordle game
        seems like sshfs is not notifying vite of changes
         though vi-ing changes on h: or the pod (in|after the sshfs mount) does cause '[vite] hmr update'
         no inotify for sshfs: unix.stackexchange.com/questions/208702
         lets mount a virtual drive of code on h:
          `virt-manager`, shutdown 'dc' (h:)
           dont get much further in there:
            "Unable to add device: unsupported configuration: 'directory' storage format is not directly supported by QEMU, use 'dir' disk type instead"
          `virsh`, edit dc
           and do as per https://libvirt.org/kbase/virtiofs.html
           finally editing some <filesystem/>, but then!
            "error: unsupported configuration: virtiofs is not yet supported in session mode"

            seems unsolved.

        `lsyncd -delay 0 -rsyncssh . h src/letz` # in s:src/letz
         why require -delay 0? to batch waves of change I suppose

         lets put h:src into a disk:
          via `virt-manager`, add ~/.local/share/libvirt/images/dc.qcow2
           then rename it to      ~/.local/share/libvirt/images/src.qcow2
           the Overview XML refers to these
            also the main one /home/s/src/stylehouse/qemu2/disk.img
          semi-automatable setup in h:
           sudo fdisk /dev/vdb, n, \n\n\n\n, w

            then if on s: `lsyncd -nodaemon -delay 0 -rsyncssh letz h src/letz`
             you get the output rather than the syslog about:
              "rsync: [Receiver] mkdir "/home/s/src/letz" failed: Permission denied (13)"
             on h: sudo chown s src
             still, "sh: svelte-kit: Permission denied"
              seems to be some ownership problem?
              it is -rwxr-xr-x by 1002, even adduser {z,s} (so s is 1002) doesnt help
              huh.

    supposedly getting replaced and recovered
     my qemus will have a two month trip to a lab in the Netherlands
      the country with the furthest-away-sounding name...
       but apparently they got there in about a week!
      coming back encrypted, with a complementary blank disk to decrypt it into!
    so, re-setting up:
     $ apt install podman
     $ sudo podman build -t cos .
      then, drama! "No space left on device"
       whilst apt install unzip curl strace vim nodejs npm
        should just use a nodejs image I suppose? using debian:bookworm-slim
       so, as per my notes, see qemu / disk++:
       $ qemu-img resize g.qcow2 +6G
       then I go into it and look at $ sudo fdisk -l /dev/vda
        drama! sudo takes ten seconds to get to password prompt
         during which ^C and ^\ do nothing
         but I vaguely remember this
          and a similar slow login via ssh
         are fixed by properly setting hostname
          it feels like a name lookup timeout
         so as root
          $ hostnamectl set-hostname g
          $ vi /etc/hosts   # adding "192.168.122.16 g"
         and all better
        lo! the partition and filesystem have already expanded!
         maybe its a quirk of the debian-*-nocloud variation this is running
         other times I had to drop+recreate the partition table, do resize2fs
      back to this half-hour apt install...
       no! lets use FROM node:slim
       and add CMD bash, vircumventing straight-into-node-ness
       and then! we are back
       supposing no interruptions it would have been down an hour...
     networking!
       makes up most of the podman 4 and qemu chapters above
       comes down to two things, iirc:
        creating a /etc/qemu/bridge.conf (see above)
         with the devices in... this was prompted by something
        and to the error when starting bridge-networked podiae:
         well simply: chmod u+s /usr/lib/qemu/qemu-bridge-helper
         starts working! I can reach the guest (192.168.122.92) from the host!

     ubuntu!
      has some weird problems
       - switching off suddenly, probably this disintegrating laptop
       - things (the terminal, chromium, vlc, kdenlive) getting uninstalled
         as in just not being there at some later time
        - the "no installation candidate" thing
           had to: sudo apt install snapd=2.58+22.10
       - 265 glitches
          seem to be from overheating, fans placed (95->82)
           throttles cpu instead of shutting off
           I tried apt install intel-media-va-driver-non-free
       - lock screen sometimes kicks in after a second of desktop is shown
       - syslog spam eg "Successfully activated service 'org.freedesktop.Tracker3.Miner.Extract'"
       - qmmp wont play wma (Ali Omar album)
       - "Command 'whois' not found, but can be installed with:"
       - no ssh-agent, I manage to set one up:
          add to ~/.profile:
            # keep an ssh agent running
            if [ -z "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" ] ; then
              eval `ssh-agent -s`
              ssh-add $HOME/.ssh/stylehouse
            fi
          then a unix-90s-style popup happens on login
       - screen-off idle time varies quite a bit
          sometimes ignores vlc playing a movie
      
      why does (every?) nocloud-backed qcow2 image of a linux system have a full disk
       have to fdisk, delete 1, recreate, etc.
        and `resize2fs /dev/vda1`
       then I may `apt install xauth` (in radioactive.qcow2)
        and `ln -s ~/.Xauthority ~/snap/brave/current/.Xauthority` https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/x11-forwarding-using-ssh/2381/7

Inc|Pro|Run
  Inc: the A:load-ing bay, does @Intro

  Run: does A** winding

  they seem to use some basic %%Go to engage each other
  
  < @Ply of other This** may clue how to time around

        as A:n, for eg w:Tut
       may take one (asyncing) or more (Esyncing) A:n
        as Step doability is interspersed with @Run++
        even when io iterating, might @Run++ somewhere per row
      and so,
      @Pro > @Run, gives it time
      @Run++ can occur as per hire,
       eg let it do this|that C a whole bunch
       is a much tighter loop

        the runloop could be a while

    @Intro and @Gnome have e:elIntro->&diffPs thinking
     @Intro for getting it to the first nodes

     @Pro thinks about what it could mean

   of that dialectic

    eg waiting for -Lab to ready before @Run

    eg letting @Story catch up now
     new kind of sanity check
     allowing reality to diffuse over there for a while
    or just letting it go for it
    as in winding or cranking up A&ov

io
 near:
  < A.h for &hajasute
 mid:
  < a few grammars for classifying to a prototype to use
   < compile io@1, handing instructs rather than string-to-parse
      eg &Sharg,$expr=expr -> &Sharg,$expr:io@1
     the a(/match/,&{...}) becomes /match/ => ...
      which may revert to runtime regex
       or pluck a piece of inlined io@1
  
  like self-confidence for the computer language
  uses the universality of hierarchy
   ability to join disparate realities
  
  expr space
   flavours of loading up parameters
   # < write stories to figure out:
    bringing $defined or $defining in+for that expr...
      see !bind $item
      say "you have to buy it again to use in io"
      complicated by the want of Xio
       to use eg $suchindex in a non-lexical sense
      but is it?
       perhaps we compile in their defs anywhere prior:
        as $suchindex = qas('suchindex','t')
         see w:Fish / X
       perhaps conversely, a lexical is got for index use
        say "get free lexical with index use"
         < is free re a lexical budget, play money.
        ie, $suchindex becomes a lexical
          for you to examine the space around $s
         in addition to the $s (perl $_)
      anyway
      perhaps X/suchindex=$someval?
       conflicts with C/such for bareword C'such'
       perhaps we would know if X index or C bareword would be used
        eg in this example it is being set to something
         maybe it could be glob: o X/suchindex*
        it should be possible to X.such = x
         I think we X.such.1 = x for now?
          see the odd glob functionality of &Xsomp
        after all, C are basically just islands to put more in
         the actual attachment being made however anything adjusts it to be
         which should start # heur-istically
         then %TX play with
         compile into qas() or io statement
       perhaps barewords are no more,
        if cm can have its perl mode adjusted to know io
         which could be a bunch of markers compiled into of:ghost
        then:
        X/#suchindex=$someval
         looks silly/
       perhaps barewords are no more,
    $key:2spec expr
     could mean more, see below
     wants to also mean eg A:thing, io:dialect, io@1 (compiled)
    and implications, vaguenesses
     marked # heur
   X/$suchindex=$someval
    bind $someval
    X climbs $suchindex
     that is, X.suchindex.$someval = x
      (usu. may unpack $someval more)
     so these look lexical but are just index name expr
    Name this @suchindex
     may then be joined to later X/$suchindex
   X/$suchindex:something
    bind $suchindex
     perhaps we know it is not a lexical at compile
    Name this @something
     kind of a named capture
     # < the $key:2spec expr:
     not the eg $expr:io@1 expression,
      which gives some object identifier there
      a powerful prescriptive
      it would depend on your io dialect
       eg &Saturn might have more $things:
      perhaps it is always available:
       eg $expr::io@1
        type of thing (io) + state (@1) to get it to
   X/@something
    join the @something there
     i|o decides INSERT|SELECT
    may know how to index @something items
     eg X/$nin=@something, following on from src?
      $nin <= $nodes_within
     or,
     # < semi-determinate scheme, for bootstrap: # heur
      currently we guess at t|s a bit in &Shx
      it should be definitely guessable by X + rows @3
      and then remember that, see Xq schemes
   C/@something
    join C/* to those items
   C/$suchindex=$somewhere
    implying C//X/$suchindex=$somewhere
    the /$suchindex= gives it away?
   C/$item:something
    bind $item
    Name this @something
    normal
    antithesis: see $key:2spec
   
   and for &h calls:
     # the &h may be compiled out, as in me&directly
   &suchfunc,$item:something
    # was meaning bind $something as 'item'
    for I.i.suchfunc to interpret
     may be a 2spec, see $key:2spec
   &suchfunc,$item=something
    set string
   fat&suchfunc
    fatal suchfunc, is I.fat.suchfunc
    as such, the&calls are for I.the@1
     &voice may know about calls via I.i.calls@6 etc
      # 6 looks like an o(utput) and an i(nput)
      #  an om+shape maker
   &suchfunc $item=$la
    named parameter for &suchfunc perspective
    may param $item=&inline,la
    is more futuristic, allows further expr:
     $item.aspect=$la
      and then breaking down a huge missing part of code:
   nesting lines within each other
    logic wants to cluster
   
   !bind $item
    eg in:
     C/$item=something
      $item will be defined in iterations eg S o ...
     &suchfunc,$item=something
      $item is on the receiving|&suchfunc end
    forces code(ers) not using arg order, anyway
     to space things out more
    they
     dont bind $item
      it is more like defining $item there
  
  tricks
   $eC = o ... # buy lexical
   o e)%C # implies s**->R** change
   o ... or return # does that
     similar to avoiding further expr once empty

lang
  see codes for the styles of writing
  - new lang compiles to old lang
     that the computer already understands
  - computer understands new lang
  compilers are a step up to a new lang
   "many more powerful expression mechanisms could be used by programmers than mere classes and procedures"
   https://ziglang.org/download/0.9.0/release-notes.html#Self-Hosted-Compiler
  you can always type less
   its nice to break through to a new language
   and type more with less
   "typing less causes death"
  lang design for merge
   minimise odds of it merging unpredictably
    esp avoid changing meaning as a result of some merge strategy

 spec
  most seriously in blocks of: =keyword...=cut
   eg, this very text
  also any: # comment on how it is
  or: # < how it should be
  conventions:
  
   indents matter
    may indented thusly
     refers to some potential of the former
    thenceward lines elabourate
     on the matter it is in
    perhaps is something we are not sure about yet
      pre-tangent
     a possible feature, maybe outlandish
     may break the language (truth) around it
      # com tangent: eg break is hilighted.
      #  not in the same headspace as the writing
      #  sometimes narrating history, eg bad idea because ...
   
   blank lines mark chonks?
    also questions can be asked, imply /^perhaps/
    the items along an indent are separate
     though the first one is likely to run on from the former
   
   cleverness of the expr
    should stay at some low level
    be as supersensible as the situation wants
    yet be available from general sense
     eg the previous 7-chunk =~ /matter/
      # orthogonal awareness, perhaps of itself
       not if see # we keep holding onto the first Q ever
        that is a link, to a comment, so is in code
       btw (another orthogonal, out of: codes / spec)
        -chunk can have a diag|expr style of its own:
         the number in front means yay many lines (geo)
         pi in front, number is either:
          Aip:chunk: -chunk@3.24.2
           may climb slope to @3
            or @3 may be a geometry (lang dependent)
        -is~/for such/ is a text search pi, etc
    tos[]
     means tos = [...anything]
   refers to itself
    spec / refers / spec is where we are now
     if the latter 'spec wants to be longer'
    see &suchfunc / if $n
     approximate chunk of &suchfunc to look at
    see resolve $n
     is the most popular reference to make
     # a cruxical ramble for computer science:
     about the trickiness to distributed lists
      that X solves by way of multiple X/*/$n
       and our selection of parts we are redoing
        eg you i the -Ness to be the canonical set now
         ie tractioning %%dome=-Ness (hypothetical)
          over an order wandering members of %%dome=-Ness|-Lab
         so drop the other -Ness, but keep the -Lab around them
          < try to gc|merge the -Lab for goners?
            the %TX may only %RX the goner, etc
            all dropped -Bat should pile up somewhere
             especially if associated to -Lab
         particular -Lab could be o during the sequence
          to involve at points in the cartesian redo
     @Gnome/&RunStep
      means the &RunStep part of the @Gnome process
      better written @Gnome / &RunStep
      similar may be an io expr
     &Eref(lookup/climb) <= &Ereflookup / &Erefclimb
      as above
   expr
    @2 is a time, or cv
    v@2 means a 20mm, one line view of a value
     eg Ctitle: Thing 3
      which could also be described as Thing@3
       but usually the @2 in an expanse they will travel
    
    expr:Cid
     the expr for eg A:thing, C:such, or &proc:id
    expr:subarg
     the sub and the arg you (can) give it
     eg &Eref c, &Xsim c.array, &sustrain c.$t+
     may mean the c returned
     or the c you (can) give to the &Eref* suite of things
     # kinda OO: c is a hemisphere of data, subname the code
    
    Aspeck
     aspect of that thing
     a topic, not a particular feature
     eg Ay: going into the A. climbing.
     eg Aline: the A may select amongst bits
     eg Cid: any C (even A etc) can draw some uniquing -Eight.t
     eg Gtime: unix time, may be offset for G-wide timetravel
      you may get your offset via A, yet:
     eg Atime: all about Aip
     eg Aip: hot topic, solve a lot of memory|crux issues
     kinda:
     eg cid: or idc, how to name random c (see &sustain)
      esp if that name is used internally
      see also expr:subarg, eg &Xsim c
    
    io bits/inside
     is kind of what language implies
      loose use eg: title Try@5 JugRice *
    regexp|js|etc are also about|mixed
    shell:
     alternations, eg lou{d,der} <= loud louder
      < row-slope for what it multiplies. the leg?

       sounds like something that needs to be built
   < todo
     needs to be built
      usual fraying off about things here
     and other deps
     may seem to conclude that:
   < some other todo
   > too much to do any time soon
      all a lower priority than any < todo
   <<<
    marks a frontier
    all the beyonds are implicitly /^</
    indent independent, merely a marker
     to slide down the todolist
   
   terse <= large implied expr
    a compression
    also, a todo:
    < D encoding (see osc Komp) made of these
   thing => its properties
    an expansion
    < compiler as nested these
       ie take meaning => in,forms  =>  action => of,forms
       opportuning into certain definable idealisms
        deep within meaning (of some complicated expression)
       eg detect specific dialect|feature and adjust the how
        eg $thing = o suchness
         needs to pick ays&thing|s out of suchness
          suchness may itself be io, &Sharg, etc
