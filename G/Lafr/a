    A Cardinal Number is a number that says how many of something there are, such as one, two, three, four, five. An Ordinal Number is a number that tells the position of something in a list, such as 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th etc. Most ordinal numbers end in "th" except for: one ⇒ first (1st) two ⇒ second (2nd)
