   every odd Codon_click should seek top of it
   Code definitely starting closed, then open
   %seekto should ttl, clear on scroll (untested)
   fengi seems ok now (doesnt init per R%Codap)
    not all R%Codap ever shui to set up R%fengi() -> f.hatch

  stylemap vertical space: Codins folding
  < help with chicken house
  < dream up something simple
    to complete & test a bunch of features:
    < Code pointer more infinitely
    < allowing rearrange of W:g-j as list of $t
    < weirdness erupting, normal quiet
    < A == R, etc...
    < sending patches to your Search host,
    < jsba, tested against everything imported,
      and all remaining js code...
    < editor only listening to its ghosts
 
 cm:
  < no 's 0.1' tooltip
  < middle click paste ! very strange, tends to not work
  later:
  < regroup Foogla etc by %Code pointers, eg # c
     curate into G/
     with similar to %tracting el:9 (drop) etc,
     wanting the human to go through it all
  < move over there, then much later:
    < import git history, as if names the whole time,
       and a W:j about the fractions/order of them
      bringing back Opera-era perl for elvising W-orkers
       and all the output channel plumbing etc
