     they seem like the step controller for &supetime
      which has very proto that
     and almost a time-dimension sort-navigator for voice
   
    the related types it bursts into:
     nowernodewant
     await poise
      demand RunSteps for elIntro/%Steps/*
    may
     be translated to Ying | supe
     nodewant: &wants      | a.pur(...wants:n)
     await ?: &wants later | a.pur(...await:opportune)
     put stuff for RunSteps
      which has the way that is changing
       a knows how to get @Run to happen if @Inc doesnt
        potentially conscious operators all the way down
    
Inc|Pro|Run
  Inc: the A:load-ing bay, does @Intro
  Pro: provisions A** questing, &Ying_waits
  Run: does A** winding
  possibly the top level callback space
  they seem to use some basic %%Go to engage each other
  
  < @Ply of other This** may clue how to time around
     where the dependencies are
      eg any Eref pointed must be there
       perhaps the pointers might &t at some selfed thing
        then referencing from &t onward on the -Ness
         -Ness would have to -Lab that &t must be around
  
   < and hire @Pro to RunStep too
     bunch of &sustrain, valley apart
     the GStep %%Go -> PStep
      GStep ref $S to Fine/*
      PStep|@Pro grants time to &Sunpit|@Run++
       later one trip through &Sunpit
        as A:n, for eg w:Tut
       may take one (asyncing) or more (Esyncing) A:n
        as Step doability is interspersed with @Run++
        even when io iterating, might @Run++ somewhere per row
      and so,
      @Pro > @Run, gives it time
      @Run++ can occur as per hire,
       eg let it do this|that C a whole bunch
       is a much tighter loop
        going from 2 extra Ying trips per @Run++ to none
       see Aip|time about how Run++ can be arbitrary
        not always per Ying wake
        the runloop could be a while

all very %%Go, #spec
    @Intro and @Gnome have e:elIntro->&diffPs thinking
     @Intro for getting it to the first nodes
     @Gnome for sequencing the change into:
     @Inc then also, takes the change, and as always:
     @Pro thinks about what it could mean
      in some non-lossy way, with @Gnome mediation possible
     @Run takes something to believe now
    so
     @Gnome RunStep > @Pro RunStep
    %%Go valleys
     are they -Effect that do Y:Easy to arrive?
     and you are -Effected by the grant
     is a long term elvis
    -Effect elsewhere eg RunningStep wants a oncer
   is
    &Effect Go:gs,...
     gs = &sustain,...
      place for its own meta, relations
     both ... depend on where in:
   Story/Thingo
    Gump realises $t ood, hires:
    Gnome checks Story/$t, hires:
    Travel makes $t/@Cat and ... by dialectic
   
   a lot
   
   of that dialectic
   is ask-compulsiveness
    eg waiting for -Lab to ready before @Run
     so they might %%Go into @Run/The the first time
    eg letting @Story catch up now
     new kind of sanity check
     allowing reality to diffuse over there for a while
    or just letting it go for it
    as in winding or cranking up A&ov
     which in &Sunpit is some sort of Aip
   is ask
    its hirer knows
     eg poise, may be now
     eg nodewant, and then poise?
   
    gang - bunch of names that get known
     eg @Cat(/*), @Gnome(/*) via Names
     eg &sustrain c.$t+

  pre-life culture
  a science of the physical universe

 near:

 mid:
  < a few grammars for classifying to a prototype to use
   < compile io@1, handing instructs rather than string-to-parse
      eg &Sharg,$expr=expr -> &Sharg,$expr:io@1
     the a(/match/,&{...}) becomes /match/ => ...
      which may revert to runtime regex
       or pluck a piece of inlined io@1
  
  like self-confidence for the computer language
  uses the universality of hierarchy
   ability to join disparate realities
  
  expr space
   flavours of loading up parameters
   # < write stories to figure out:
    bringing $defined or $defining in+for that expr...
      see !bind $item
      say "you have to buy it again to use in io"
      complicated by the want of Xio
       to use eg $suchindex in a non-lexical sense
      but is it?
       perhaps we compile in their defs anywhere prior:
        as $suchindex = qas('suchindex','t')
         see w:Fish / X
       perhaps conversely, a lexical is got for index use
        say "get free lexical with index use"
         < is free re a lexical budget, play money.
        ie, $suchindex becomes a lexical
          for you to examine the space around $s
         in addition to the $s (perl $_)
      anyway
      perhaps X/suchindex=$someval?
       conflicts with C/such for bareword C'such'
       perhaps we would know if X index or C bareword would be used
        eg in this example it is being set to something
         maybe it could be glob: o X/suchindex*
        it should be possible to X.such = x
         I think we X.such.1 = x for now?
          see the odd glob functionality of &Xsomp
        after all, C are basically just islands to put more in
         the actual attachment being made however anything adjusts it to be
         which should start # heur-istically
         then %TX play with
         compile into qas() or io statement
       perhaps barewords are no more,
        if cm can have its perl mode adjusted to know io
         which could be a bunch of markers compiled into of:ghost
        then:
        X/#suchindex=$someval
         looks silly/
       perhaps barewords are no more,
    $key:2spec expr
     could mean more, see below
     wants to also mean eg A:thing, io:dialect, io@1 (compiled)
    and implications, vaguenesses
     marked # heur
   X/$suchindex=$someval
    bind $someval
    X climbs $suchindex
     that is, X.suchindex.$someval = x
      (usu. may unpack $someval more)
     so these look lexical but are just index name expr
    Name this @suchindex
     may then be joined to later X/$suchindex
   X/$suchindex:something
    bind $suchindex
     perhaps we know it is not a lexical at compile
    Name this @something
     kind of a named capture
     # < the $key:2spec expr:
     not the eg $expr:io@1 expression,
      which gives some object identifier there
      a powerful prescriptive
      it would depend on your io dialect
       eg &Saturn might have more $things:
      perhaps it is always available:
       eg $expr::io@1
        type of thing (io) + state (@1) to get it to
   X/@something
    join the @something there
     i|o decides INSERT|SELECT
    may know how to index @something items
     eg X/$nin=@something, following on from src?
      $nin <= $nodes_within
     or,
     # < semi-determinate scheme, for bootstrap: # heur
      currently we guess at t|s a bit in &Shx
      it should be definitely guessable by X + rows @3
      and then remember that, see Xq schemes
   C/@something
    join C/* to those items
   C/$suchindex=$somewhere
    implying C//X/$suchindex=$somewhere
    the /$suchindex= gives it away?
   C/$item:something
    bind $item
    Name this @something
    normal
    antithesis: see $key:2spec
   
   and for &h calls:
     # the &h may be compiled out, as in me&directly
   &suchfunc,$item:something
    # was meaning bind $something as 'item'
    for I.i.suchfunc to interpret
     may be a 2spec, see $key:2spec
   &suchfunc,$item=something
    set string
   fat&suchfunc
    fatal suchfunc, is I.fat.suchfunc
    as such, the&calls are for I.the@1
     &voice may know about calls via I.i.calls@6 etc
      # 6 looks like an o(utput) and an i(nput)
      #  an om+shape maker
   &suchfunc $item=$la
    named parameter for &suchfunc perspective
    may param $item=&inline,la
    is more futuristic, allows further expr:
     $item.aspect=$la
      and then breaking down a huge missing part of code:
   nesting lines within each other
    logic wants to cluster
   
   !bind $item
    eg in:
     C/$item=something
      $item will be defined in iterations eg S o ...
     &suchfunc,$item=something
      $item is on the receiving|&suchfunc end
    forces code(ers) not using arg order, anyway
     to space things out more
    they
     dont bind $item
      it is more like defining $item there
  
  tricks
   $eC = o ... # buy lexical
   o e)%C # implies s**->R** change
   o ... or return # does that
     similar to avoiding further expr once empty

  buy lexicals per sub, unit of space like room

  %TX to %RX
   want an io flavour
    know qua.ope is number

    know the two+ times it can leap out,
     as well as iterative match when identity grows
      all sorts of stuff can be described for a C**
       presence of any %TX for desc thing can cause desc to try early
       eg a previous state of D** @36 can sleep laters
        ie osc doesnt wake up
lang
  - new lang compiles to old lang
     that the computer already understands
  - computer understands new lang
  compilers are a step up to a new lang
   "many more powerful expression mechanisms could be used by programmers than mere classes and procedures"
  you can always type less
   its nice to break through to a new language
   and type more with less
   "typing less causes death"
  lang design for merge
   minimise odds of it merging unpredictably
    esp avoid changing meaning as a result of some merge strategy
     getting 'it' in a lump helps
   while having unpredictable content

        -chunk can have a diag|expr style of its own:

         pi in front, number is either:
          Aip:chunk: -chunk@3.24.2
           may climb slope to @3

     may mean the c returned
     or the c you (can) give to the &Eref* suite of things
     # kinda OO: c is a hemisphere of data, subname the code
    
    Aspeck
     aspect of that thing
     a topic, not a particular feature
     eg Ay: going into the A. climbing.
     eg Aline: the A may select amongst bits
     eg Cid: any C (even A etc) can draw some uniquing -Eight.t
     eg Gtime: unix time, may be offset for G-wide timetravel
      you may get your offset via A, yet:
     eg Atime: all about Aip
     eg Aip: hot topic, solve a lot of memory|crux issues
     kinda:
     eg cid: or idc, how to name random c (see &sustain)
      esp if that name is used internally
      see also expr:subarg, eg &Xsim c
    
    io bits/inside
     is kind of what language implies
      loose use eg: title Try@5 JugRice *
    regexp|js|etc are also about|mixed
    shell:
     alternations, eg lou{d,der} <= loud louder
      < row-slope for what it multiplies. the leg?
     eg having a {house,family,grandkids} at the right time
    ie <= that is
    eg gives example
     inners like so discuss|continue it
   a question?
    is up for debate|clarity|art
     eg:     e:r to @Gnome itself is reliable?
      whereas:          ...itself should be reliable
       sounds like something that needs to be built
   < todo
     needs to be built
      usual fraying off about things here
     and other deps
     may seem to conclude that:
   < some other todo
   <<<
    marks a frontier
    all the beyonds are implicitly /^</
    indent independent, merely a marker
     to slide down the todolist
   
   terse <= large implied expr
    a compression
    also, a todo:
    < D encoding (see osc Komp) made of these
   thing => its properties
    an expansion
    < compiler as nested these
       ie take meaning => in,forms  =>  action => of,forms
       opportuning into certain definable idealisms
        deep within meaning (of some complicated expression)
       eg detect specific dialect|feature and adjust the how
        eg $thing = o suchness
         needs to pick ays&thing|s out of suchness
          suchness may itself be io, &Sharg, etc
           eg &Sharg would add .N[0] to pluck result
 
 spec > notes,cal,todo...
     notes
      casual spec, eg w:a
      some relaxed panache
     cal
      headings indenting per:
       2 weeks, 1 day, day item, subitem, discussion**
      structure of w:a before shattering into:
     todo
      first first
       larger clusters evolve into spec/*
      eg later w:a, which seems to only grow?
       < stats about grow|shrink of /^</ there, anywhere
     not
      casual notes
       input only, text only, like `cat >> not`
        with next commit
        < stylehut should: put away Story/$now/-not for each session
      maximum relaxed panache
      link dump, try and label, timestamp things
      always at x:50%,y:100%
     drugs
      stuff people have written on various drugs
       some of which can describe quite clearly
        how to build the universe etc
        handy knowledge to have

 stylehouse
  raku -> raku
 stylehut
  what raku compiles -> js
  will be what runs stylehut
   the first real stylehouse website
   so compiling will rely on you getting serve.raku
    or public compile infrastructure
    or someone will get the grammars working in js
    < have a look at acorn.js
  superset of:
 styleshed
  what &JaBabz compiles -> js
  mostly compatible with &CoBabbler ( -> perl)
