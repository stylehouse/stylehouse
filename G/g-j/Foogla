# Domes prepare to A=A!
$me = 4c&me;
!me and throw "no me";
$io = me.io;

=head1 #prepare to A=A

some goals!!
- efficiently educating on A passage of time
- J to take < 200ms
- not noticing anyway
- Elvising running the shower
- unpatch, failing, patch, passing in a few seconds

=head3 future of sleep: Doming
A starts works, D are their completion

   C   E
 A   D 
   C   C

A C9[C...] completes D and elvises a clone
 D commits Gs, Es swarm T (*/W/*)
  G wants the resources near-ish
  T returns to the desire resolver

D - the Aing grouping items sprout inside
  z C & A to include C/group A workload
  provide osc-like cha/continuity without osc,
    yet be the atomicness osc uses to commit,
    and load with decor/nativities to make for mediation
      R:I is now being the osc workload gatherer + commit
        which should work on >=1 'pages' of osc at a time
          eg elvising from ...
          or the whole/9er
        rolling the others,
        being able to async progress,
          do work in parallel or not...
make unities early to sleep/calculate desires better
  eg. when A is @28, the state can be considered D:early
  eg. when Jpin, S makes domes, which can then be known about
internal buzz. pages of its ground.
  get composited into D:top, C9[C...] post-osc
  which gets hoisted/elvised into J/W timespace elsewhere,
    the macro-J Doming-looking action: hosting stuff.
so to:
  make arbitrary groups
    for groups sake:
      naming stuff
      handling streams
    to stabilise/refine our sense of activity
  transport C out of time,
    so J>7 can help J<7 (sleep)
    osc-think may play with things outside of osc,
     < holds that state in a dome it hopes to pull in?
  locate them as possible actions,
    as bumping into a S-ection kinda defines it
      < more at compile time
    and elvis handlers... 1s&ein.sayeth = &acgts{
  know inputs in a tracable way
    Elvising pointing in here,
      as Teing is
    giving Desire pathways to trace processes

Domes may iterate X/V or some structure from another Dome,
  it may be important to iterate locally and do remotely,
    they become transactions
Desire might want to do something,
as a new elvis pointing into here would
 Teing is a kind of elvising
   and is the float:right upside down triangle of stuff
     the small network-edge pile coming down into
     the big contenty pile of isness
 Schemas too, float their potential/unfoldment
   down holes they start matching

#c sleep/done =head2 sleep tunnel

%slep, a Tool probe

  < more timely %differ growing out of it
  real interesting later

< Elvisory re-slaning on %push to it?
   is the elvis delivery mechanism:
    give edifice of deliverableness
     resolve to best case or so:
   if it were a different J:
    enter it, changes input to thisJ
    decide to redome thisJ to involve that,
      or seeing our change come back to us
   Matu-ish out-of-time with %push gravitate reruns
  redo R building on changed elvisory?
  see 'rebuild %push to use e'
   %push currently injects the remote %ball%movingin
     which will not work if its asleep
     but it could be brought around about as fast if:
< Te the %moves to Elvisory/anywhere
   with a watch for completion and callback/expiry
< universal vision of rc&ha.dup,
< replace ravel with Doming and Display2
< TEST io.i z much

# another
o rebuild I via Babd ways
 o link G/ to W/G so we can update it ourselves
 o get a Lis rolling nicely
  o tests sign the version as it percolates
o rebuild jsBab in js
 o fast way changes, lots of test results if you want
 o check against jsBabz for j/2/*

o 'rebuild %push to use e'
  %checkout the tangley varieties of %push

o unify name extrusion (see names extruding)
  like X but with where/when to D,
    alt names and fuzzentations (figure name changes)
      inc. crunchable path descriptions in various datalang
    universal gone/unnoticed system

make this data pointer (Cit)
 add %doings that Cit the same way
   and can share refs perfectly,
   showing where internals began
     set free with an everything bisector

good study.

  a bunch of R not expecting J overhead
  rebuilding on the Co Joinup (W of W)
    having it bring G (map of its dependencies) (see Give)
      as an %H of a different name
        once osc piles of whatever hoisting is?
          not much doc about osc hoisting:
           the W/of/t may W/what/ever/it/takes/t
           for stats/accounting
  Matu process with %ball
    mapping the mapped into a transform,
      redoing parts, remixing

o and then making a coderupper and way in-outer
  to the rest of the rennovation...
    starting a new page of html,
      built-in and W-contiguous
        the simple funtimes embedded in the page,
        if browser compatible, Wake up and do anything
    I-ing up Sevo, then placing more A-ily,

o names extruding, like X but with:
  connection to a dome:
    where/when they would have emerged (gonerism)
      eg. from the ground, or some picking of Rc&s
        done-ish by %slep
          could describe path or so
    decide once D:in !%more
      D:new == D:old to sleep, or:
      clone D:new to D:out and ...
        becomes someones D:in
          border control
    
o Display2, that goes via X instead of yup:
    traversal iterators that choose a name system to use,
      X is the given base name system

o elvising coming out or going in on the X
  and transacting the change of it
   as Domes, which have versions of Domes going into them
   an osc that keeps everything it sees would be first
    and be the wandering frontiers of change
 
o making the R an A.
  compiling ravel into throat?

fairly slow slow, need:
 more sleep (R to 1/2 and no further) (%slep)

   < diffing T/$W:edges <-> W:PuTe/$W:edges,

        common Lis sense:

have R that can simply keep Ringing?
 < osc must get us back into whatever Ring:
   init: Ring@1 everything (Graze)
   then: resumes all Is&z
  the cores may fall asleep at random
   and may still percolate a Display anyway
   or lock the dome it was finishing from starting again
see I and repackage:
   A:u makes .I
     mixed from many .I,
     got from /js/
     with async for update/check
   A.4:
    has loop bits, local culture
    .I:
     is everything, mixed up with StyleHut
     .i is all StyleHut,
      figure out what we need to keep
     never goes async, is trusted to be maintained,
     .w:
      has only this %namedcode thing
   A.5:
     looks neglected
     .w:
      is the spot, y&tw for $way
       they s&dige and s&now, G&way asyncs
       want to digwaypoll them, make sync
      all scooped up by Shovel, per test run
       which can make sync prior
I.w is totally incidental,
1s&minds[uname] = A c&N[4s&mind[t]]
 u deals with W via /js/, mixes onto Normal
G&question (and other asyncers) should provide:
  ttl, ready=1 on callback
 to be useful for testing this stuff efficiently

 how it starts:
   html <script> get & eval from /thestart?step=n
    sends it A&loadI and Stylehut
     which includes HutNuts (begoin/jsung)
   G&begoin -> G&jsung,'NutMachine' cb -> G&Jinthe
     jsung looks like A:u but overwrites any A.I[t] = W:of it loads
     Jinthe sets up listeners,
      waylays NutGravy, defines function,
       waylays NutReady, more waylays.
 
 will start:
 < A&loadI a simple A:u@6 etc for basic mind mixing
   gather more mind, global functions, start loop
  should less async, and:
   be totally new ev/e hookup:
    Display:
     lose on.A
      use attr t/cv, attr sip if sJ
      and lookup to the sips of 4s somewhere global
      A.4 must always know about elvising
     lose jQuery,
      moving elements only as needed,
      text inputs not rebuilding every time
   
   ways to keep track of updates...
    make an islanding that can digwaypoll for:
      w change
      W change is regular /W/ with dige...
    know W that contain other W we are watching,
      digwaypoll for notify of W changing?
      could be wired into /W/
       not for the same socket?
     future /W/ storer is an elvising with a route,
      only then demands stringify to get across the net

s&R:
  how to conjoin an other:
the ground wakes up, doing a J (R for now)
from a C%ball describing the J

 %R=+Save gives %ball%Save
   < separate that kind of thing to %A
  
if no ^^4%Gens:
 R=Tool makes %ball/r%Tool
   s.sc -> r.sc
   s%z -> r%nz
     is the out %ball cluster continuing inside
       waking up into this layeR
else:
 R=Tool makes %ball/s.t%Gens%ting/r%Tool
  %Gens creates the thing with memory
   if sc&el=1
     !%ting
   else
     initialises Livec&Tool=1,
       out-s* able to form high level pictures
     Live.c also -> r.sc

%R=1-9 turns into %Doming (the slope)

< %MindInto projects R=... to make thinks into Know/**%ball
  leaving the insphere intermediacies savable

< above may have %methods to continue through our being
  %methods over slopes

%Gens:
  for/in R%ball (usually)
  wakes up R/%Gens/r with its memory
    got via %Gens%ting unless in outs-only mode (sc&el=1)
   < cautiously if no memory:
  < care to authenticate code running by it

%JRom:
  domes it if s&R>=3:
< elvising (networking)
   %ting consumes stuff from the network
    so people opening the same thing get connected
    and theres a spout for updates/locks
   for acts of change
    to have a formal place
    and they may be 
   see Ravelvis etc

%Gensing:
< from %Gens, mediates %other <-> %self
  commits a tree in either direction
    syncing pieces required for a coherent there/%other
    as eg the /W/ server would do until all %H are
  
  doing ballio
  
  setting policy
  
  learning qualities
  
  control:
    is an expression separate from data
    
    r%Doming=2, an A.2 slope, unless no ^^4
      levels have many definitions, create slopes
        are points of interest/tingingdoms
    < %whaT to overlay/inject/control
      mucking with I/anything going into it
  
  compression/difference:
    how out%ball -> in%ball
      loading our changes on top of it
      %MindInto out%ball/* are W mixing into it
        in W surfing mode, when you employ %MindInto
    how out%ball <- in%ball
      keeping a vague picture, like %species=4
      %MindInto keeps the 1C only, with $W%H,dig,v,etc
        merging with the Live, which is for notes etc
         mix-figurations

s&W/s&J eventually do this, growing from A.4/A.1
  pinning /way/s.t to define it

'doing from and growing from' will + joints

R=\d+ could mean slopality, instantiatia:
 2: should be remembered
 3: must be Domed
 4: follow children first?
   %MindInto would set this up as its iterating
 5/6: thinkingabout/supposing theyre all processes

< auto %play any %Doming=3/*%R
  supposing theyre all processes,
  not bits of a process
    the for later/someoneelse phenomenon
    the lum, line, probably to do out/in%ball
 < know boundaries, where awareness should end
   usu where %otherstuff begins, or time
   play with making it wake up too hard

   the %mund is posting things around,

   tracks stored compilings, eg:
    /W/way/$w -> /W/Comp/$w

       a g/(\w+)/(\d+) is such, looks like kv yaml

    translating old -> new ghosts:
      io.*, me.* into W with of:W but not W:of
       such are the new ghost objects
        as g/\w+/\d+ but with a 9,
        thence all of io is in one tidy packet,
        its source compiles out closer to you,
        its tests compile into Tests
      NutMachine probably wants conversion
