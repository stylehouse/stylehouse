=head2 description

High-concept programming language. Compiles to javascript.

The goals are:
 - beautiful, expressive blobs of code that a 12 year old could work on
 - a linguistic foundation negating the need for CRUD and the apparentness of boundaries
 - able to generate lots of visual stimuli for faster teaching, inspection
 - able to turn sessions into a television format tuned for communication
 - allow anything to grow apart and facilitate reunification, socially

So jump in! Look for /\bio\b/, the new data-claw, which may abstract SQL some day. Or maybe '^\s+=', which are documentations. Email me for help. There are reset buttons.

Warning: research-grade software. Tidier top-level runtimes are emerging, eg Fish. Currently a long commute through several layers, see ?Wayout/... below

run ./serve.pl

=head2 http://edit.localhost:1812

changes G/*

Won't load its own code changes:
location.host =~ /edit/ and GhodigWap/noGhodig%toggle control this.

=head2 http://localhost:1812/?Wayout/Fingo

uses G/*, changes W/*

a variety of things are available from here.

see also ?Wayout/Thy, currently redoing the Story observer (Gnome) and building Fish.

specifically the Fus test, which is scripted in G/Lafr/Fus and recorded in W/Stories/Fus.
